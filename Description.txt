Robocode is a programming game where you write the AI (robot “brain”) for a virtual battle tank. Your robot competes against others in an arena, where the objective is to outsmart and destroy enemy robots using code. Robots move around a battlefield, scan for enemies with radar, and fire bullets.

Java code (or .NET code if using that version) to control movement, targeting, firing, and strategies. It's widely used for learning AI, algorithms, and Java programming in a fun and competitive way。

In this project, me and my teammates have made our tank to be:

Appearance:
Robot body = blue
Gun = green
Bullets = yellow

Radar & Gun Setup:
Radar spins continuously to keep scanning.
Gun and radar move independently of the robot’s body.

Movement:
Normally moves forward while turning at a 45° angle (creates circling motion).
If too close to walls → calculates direction back toward the center and moves away.

Enemy Detection (onScannedRobot):
When an enemy is spotted, turns the gun toward it.
Fires (but currently firepower is set incorrectly to 1000, should be 0.1–3).
Keeps radar locked on the enemy.

Getting Hit (onHitByBullet):
When hit by a bullet, turns perpendicular to the incoming fire and moves forward to try dodging.

Utility:
Includes an angle normalization helper so turning angles stay within [-180°, 180°].
